# Spring-Damper-System-Simulation
This project models and simulates a mass–spring–damper system using MATLAB Simulink. It demonstrates how a mechanical system responds to external force with spring stiffness and damping effects.  The governing equation is:  𝑚 𝑥 ¨ + 𝑐 𝑥 ˙ + 𝑘 𝑥 = 𝐹 ( 𝑡 ) m x ¨ +c x ˙ +kx=F(t)
